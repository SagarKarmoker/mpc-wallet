# MPC Wallet - Feature List

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
A Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallet built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Ethers.js that implements Shamir's Secret Sharing for secure key management.

## âœ… Currently Implemented Features

### Core MPC Functionality
- **Shamir's Secret Sharing Implementation**
  - Key splitting using 3-of-2 threshold scheme
  - Secure key reconstruction from shares
  - Hex string conversion for share storage

### API Endpoints
- **Wallet Creation (`GET /api/wallet`)**
  - Generates new Ethereum wallet using ethers.js
  - Splits private key into 3 shares using SSS
  - Returns wallet address and key shares

- **Wallet Recovery (`POST /api/wallet`)**
  - Reconstructs private key from provided shares
  - Validates minimum share requirement (2 of 3)
  - Returns complete wallet data (address, private key)

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
